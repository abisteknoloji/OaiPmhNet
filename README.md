OaiPmhNet
=========

OaiPmhNet is a .NET library implementing the OAI-PMH specification. 
The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. 
Data Providers are repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. 
Service Providers then make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. 
OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP.
